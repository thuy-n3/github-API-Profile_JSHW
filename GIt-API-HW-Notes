Recreate the HTML and CSS for the Github tab page (https://github.com/matthiasak?tab=repositories) as your design, and using two AJAX requests/Promises, pull your own profile information from Github:

Your profile: https://api.github.com/users/<username>
Your repos: https://api.github.com/users/<username>/repos
After loading data from the Github API, write at least the following information to the DOM:

name
blog
location
email
an <img> with its source as the avatar_url
html_url
for each repo owned by your user, list that repo in a <ul>
Adventure Mode

Include an <input> tag on your page that will allow users to search for a particular GitHub account. Once the user presses enter in the <input> tag, your app should make a new request to the GitHub server, and display information for the corresponding user.
